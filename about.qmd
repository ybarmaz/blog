My background is in theoretical physics (quantum fields and strings) and I now work as a data scientist in the pharmaceutical industry. I focus mostly on quantitative methods in drug development, optimization of business processes, and recently probabilistic modeling to support the development of next generation nanopore sequencers.

In my spare time, I enjoy ski touring, mountain biking and cycling, especially in the Swiss Alps where I grew up.

In this blog, I am sharing learnings from my data science and applied mathematics journey.
