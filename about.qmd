I am a machine learning data scientist at Apple, where I work on algorithm evaluation. Before that I was at Roche, building large language model applications for clinical development. I also spent some time in the clinical quality assurance organization, and in the statistical modeling group supporting the development of [nanopore sequencers](https://sequencing.roche.com/global/en/home.html).

My background is in theoretical physics (quantum fields and strings) and I have some experience working in finance.

In my spare time, I enjoy ski touring, mountain biking and cycling, especially in the Swiss Alps where I grew up.

In this blog, I am sharing learnings from my data science and applied mathematics journey.
